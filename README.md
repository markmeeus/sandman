# Sandman

**Executable notebooks for HTTP APIs**

Sandman is a tool for creating living API documentation and testing workflows. Write interactive notebooks that combine Lua code with Markdown‚Äîmake HTTP requests, spin up servers, test webhooks, and document your API workflows in git-friendly files.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Beta Software**: Sandman is actively under development. While it's already quite usable for real work, expect to encounter bugs and unfinished features. Your feedback and contributions are very welcome!

## What is Sandman?

Sandman lets you write API workflows as executable notebooks. Each notebook is a Markdown file containing blocks of Lua code that run sequentially with shared state. It's like Jupyter for HTTP APIs‚Äîbut optimized for API testing, mocking, and documentation.

**Desktop Editor + HTTP Engine**: Sandman is a desktop application that combines a notebook-style editor with a powerful HTTP engine. Write your Lua scripts in the interactive editor, and the built-in engine executes them‚Äîmaking HTTP requests, spinning up servers, and managing all the networking for you. Everything runs locally on your machine, keeping your API keys and data secure.

**Markdown Native**: At its core, Sandman is built around Markdown. Your notebooks are just plain `.md` files with executable Lua code blocks. Open them in any text editor, diff them in git, review them in pull requests‚Äîthey're just Markdown. Sandman reads and writes the same Markdown format you already know, making your executable notebooks readable and editable anywhere.

### Key Features

- üìù **Executable Documentation** - Your docs and tests are the same file. If it runs, it's correct.
- üîÑ **Stateful Workflows** - Each code block builds on previous blocks' state. Chain requests together naturally.
- üåê **Client & Server** - Make HTTP requests *and* create HTTP endpoints in the same notebook.
- üìä **Request Inspection** - Every HTTP request and response is automatically captured and inspectable.
- üì¶ **Git-Native** - Plain Markdown files with executable Lua blocks. Perfect for version control.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Desktop App** - Interactive app for macOS (Windows & Linux coming soon).

## Quick Examples

### Making HTTP Requests

```lua
-- Fetch data from an API
response = sandman.http.get("https://api.github.com/users/octocat")
print("Status:", response.status)

-- Parse JSON response
user = sandman.json.decode(response.body)
print("Username:", user.login)
print("Repos:", user.public_repos)

-- Use data from previous block in next request
repos_response = sandman.http.get(user.repos_url)
repos = sandman.json.decode(repos_response.body)
print("Found", #repos, "repositories")
```

### Creating HTTP Endpoints

```lua
-- Start a local HTTP server
server = sandman.server.start(8080)

-- Add a GET endpoint
sandman.server.get(server, "/hello", function(request)
    return {
        body = "Hello, " .. (request.query.name or "World") .. "!"
    }
end)

-- Add a POST endpoint
sandman.server.post(server, "/api/users", function(request)
    local data = sandman.json.decode(request.body)
    return {
        status = 201,
        body = sandman.json.encode({
            message = "User created",
            user = data
        })
    }
end)

print("Server running on http://localhost:8080")
```

### Testing Webhooks

```lua
-- Set up a webhook receiver
server = sandman.server.start(7010)

webhook_data = nil
sandman.server.post(server, "/webhook", function(request)
    webhook_data = sandman.json.decode(request.body)
    print("Received webhook:", webhook_data)
    return {body = "ok"}
end)

-- In another block, trigger the webhook
response = sandman.http.post("http://localhost:7010/webhook",
    {["Content-Type"] = "application/json"},
    sandman.json.encode({event = "test", timestamp = os.time()})
)

-- Verify the webhook was received
print("Webhook data:", webhook_data)
```

### Complete API Workflow

```lua
-- Authenticate
auth_response = sandman.http.post("https://api.example.com/auth/login",
    {["Content-Type"] = "application/json"},
    sandman.json.encode({
        email = "user@example.com",
        password = "secret"
    })
)

auth_data = sandman.json.decode(auth_response.body)
token = auth_data.token

-- Use token in subsequent requests
user_response = sandman.http.get("https://api.example.com/user/profile",
    {["Authorization"] = "Bearer " .. token}
)

profile = sandman.json.decode(user_response.body)
print("Logged in as:", profile.name)

-- Update profile
update_response = sandman.http.put("https://api.example.com/user/profile",
    {
        ["Authorization"] = "Bearer " .. token,
        ["Content-Type"] = "application/json"
    },
    sandman.json.encode({bio = "Updated from Sandman!"})
)
```

## Why Sandman?

**The Problem**: API documentation gets outdated the moment you write it. Postman collections live in proprietary formats. Integration tests are buried in code nobody reads.

**The Solution**: What if your documentation was executable? What if it lived in git, ran real requests, and proved itself correct every time?

Sandman notebooks are:
- **Human-readable** - Plain Markdown with Lua code blocks
- **Executable** - Run your docs to verify they work
- **Git-friendly** - Diff, merge, and review like any code file
- **Self-documenting** - Mix code with explanations naturally
- **Portable** - Just Markdown files, no proprietary formats

## Use Cases

- **Living Documentation** - Document endpoints with working examples
- **API Testing** - Create test suites that double as documentation
- **Workflow Testing** - Test multi-step API flows with real state
- **API Mocking** - Spin up mock servers to replace external dependencies
- **Integration Testing** - Test webhook receivers and API clients together
- **Onboarding** - New team members run notebooks to learn the API
- **Exploration** - Experiment with third-party APIs interactively

## Getting Started

### Installation

Download Sandman for macOS from [sandmanapp.com](https://sandmanapp.com) (or build from source).

*Windows, Linux, and CLI versions coming soon*

### Your First Notebook

1. Launch Sandman and open a folder
2. Create a new file (e.g., `my-first-test.md`)
3. Add a code block and write some Lua code
4. Run it with `‚åò+Enter` or the Run button
5. Add markdown blocks to document what you're testing
6. Commit to git like any other file

See the [documentation](https://sandmanapp.com) for complete guides and API reference.
